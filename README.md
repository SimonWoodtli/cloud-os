My personal Linux Fedora Silverblue image with a cloud-native approach. 

This project is possible thanks to the amazing work from [uBlue] üôè  
I learned a lot from their codebase and used that knowledge to develop my own
offshoot of it.

## Installation

1. verify image: `cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/simonwoodtli/cloud-os:latest` (NEED TO figure out if URL can be used for cosign.pub instead of locally safing it)

After installing Silverblue simply rebase to my up to date custom image.  
`sudo rpm-ostree rebase --experimental ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/simonwoodtli/cloud-os:latest` 


## Features

* Reliable, atomic updates with built in rollback
* Reduces time to configure Linux on a fresh install drastically
* Ships with flatpak, flathub only
* Ships with distrobox
* Ships with my terminal-centric [workspace]
* Ships with Qemu/Virt-Manager or VMware (not sure yet)
* Auto updates the base Fedora image and the my additional packages on a daily
  basis.
* Hosted on ghcr.io
